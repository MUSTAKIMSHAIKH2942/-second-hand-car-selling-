<h1>Set a budget</h1>
<br>
Set a budget before you start the used car buying process. Just like it is in case of buying a new car, it’s fairly easy to end up over-spending when going for a second-hand vehicle. So, consider factors like how long do you plan to keep the vehicle, how much do you plan to use your vehicle every month, general maintenance and repair costs of the car models that you might consider buying. Also, keep in factors like car insurance in mind.
<br>

<h1>What type of car should you buy?</h1>
<br>
It’s also imperative to know what car suits your needs and lifestyle. For example, those who live in areas with bad roads should opt for a vehicle with high ground clearance. On the other hand, people looking for a comfortable highway cruiser that can carry enough luggage can opt for an MPV or a sedan.
<br>
Basically, make a list of things that you would need from your used car and then, start looking for that of type models which fall in your budget. You can use our car price calculator to figure out the right resale value of any vehicle.
<br>
<h1>Check out the used cars in day light</h1>
<br>
At times, the used car showrooms have many fancy-looking coloured lights, which make the old cars look more glamorous. It’s even a good way to hide the scratches. Therefore, the best way to examine cars is when they are parked in the daylight. This way, by viewing the vehicle in natural lighting condition, you can clearly come across even the minor scratches or paint fades.

<br>

<h1>1.How old is ‘old’?</h1><br>
Mostly, a car that is only two years old and has run less than 20,000 km is a decent bet. However, based on your budget, you can even go for an older car, especially if it’s still production and/or its spares are easily available. However, it’s advisable to stay away from cars that have been chauffeur-driven as they tend to age quickly. Also, it’s common for many to tamper with the odometer and lower its reading in a bid to con the potential buyers.
<br>
Hence, always check the service records. Doing so will not only help you understand how much the car has actually run but it can even help you ascertain if the car has been regularly serviced at the authorised service stations.
<br>
<br>
<h1>2.Get the car checked by a mechanic</h1>
<br>
You might have been using cars for years or even have a fair amount of understanding of the mechanical components, but it’s in your best interest to take a skilled mechanic along to inspect the vehicle you plan to buy. Not only will the mechanic have a good eye for even the smallest of niggles, he will even give you an idea of the cost of repair work.
<br>
<br>
<h1>3.Check VIN and obtain service records</h1><br>
Every car that is sold comes with a unique Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). Using this distinct number, you gather many details, like date of manufacturer of the car and even the service records from the authorized service centres.
<br>
<br>
<h1>4.Check insurance records</h1>
<br>

You can easily gather data on all the insurance claims made at the service centre. Through this, you can easily understand what all the vehicle has been through in its life and the kind of mishaps it has been involved in. Mostly, car owners get repairs done at authorized dealerships through insurance.

<h1>5.Take a long test drive, multiple times</h1>
<br>
<br>
Take the car you plan to buy on a long test drive. In fact, take it on multiple test drives. You can even ask your mechanic or a friend to drive the car and see what he feels about it. When driving the vehicle, make sure you accelerate a bit hard to see if the engine behaves normally. Also, brake hard and take some tight turns to understand the condition of the brakes and the steering. Also, drive on a broken stretch of road to figure out the condition of suspension.
<br>
<br>
<h1>Look for rust spots</h1>
<br>
Check out the car’s body shell thoroughly. It’s best to stay away from vehicles even with small rust spots. Rust weakens the metal and reduces the structural rigidity of the vehicle. It’s also a task to get rid of the rust patches. Make sure you check the car’s underbelly, running boards and engine mounts for rust.
<br>
<h1>Dealer tricks</h1>
<br>
If you are buying a car from a dealer, make sure that you keep in mind that the salesperson can easily misguide you to put your hard-earned money on a lemon. It’s not like all salesmen are cunning but it’s still not the most advisable option to purchase a used vehicle from a second-hand car dealer.
<br>
To help you save yourself from such crooked dealers, we, at Cars24, offer a really wide range of pre-owned vehicles to assist you with choosing the perfect used car for yourself. You can even avoid going to these dealers to sell your used car as we can even help you sell your car online and get the best price for it.

<h1>Reasons Why You Should Buy a Used Car</h1><br>
<br>
    
    <h1> Reason 1: Save money and you can even upgrade your segment---</h1>
<br>
<p>
All it takes is less than a minute for a new car, straight out from a showroom, to lose 8-10% of its purchase price as it enters used car territory. Going for used purchase means you have to pay a lot less than the original value of the car (depending on year of manufacture and kilometres done) which means you can save some serious money.      
<br>
Consider the example of a new Maruti Suzuki Swift Lxi available in New Delhi, costing close to Rs 5, 28,057 on road. Here is the breakup: Ex showroom Rs 4,71,613 + RTO Rs 18,948 + Insurance 17,689 + Other charges Rs. 19,807 = Rs 5,28, 057. Now, considering depreciation, suppose if you go for a 1 year old, same car and model (Swift LXi Delhi) which is roughly driven 12,000 km, it can be yours by paying only Rs 4,15,000/- if you buy from a dealership and Rs 3,85,000/- if buy directly from an individual first owner. You can clearly see the difference that you will be saving when opting for a used car. 
<br>
Why stop here? In case you have a specific budget in mind, you can even jump a segment and opt for a slightly older car model in the same price-band and get a better car than what you thought of in the first place. Suppose if your budget is around 4 lacs+ and you are considering a year old Maruti Suzuki Swift you can also easily get a 2011 Hyundai i20 Asta (top model) between 3.75 . 4.15 lacs with close to 28,000- 35,000 km done which has a lot of features and is a higher segment car.

<h1>Reason 2: Tension free drive 24x7 ---</h1>>
<br>
A used car comes with its own perks. The primary benefit has to be the feeling of driving tension-free, without the jitters of getting that first dent or scratch, something only a brand new car is prone to. You can even take it out for longer journeys as soon as you buy the car, since taking a brand new car out for longer trips before the first service or inspection is something buyers avoid.  
<br>
Let’s understand this better. First, suppose you just bought a brand new Hyundai i10 and the very second day you are asked to travel to a congested part of the city for work. Considering the potential risk of getting dents or scratches, chances are that you might not even take your new car out and choose public transportation instead. Now, consider the same scenario when you just bought the same used car instead. Now, you won’t really hesitate much in taking your car through those narrow lanes, would you?

Reason 3: No cheating here, now get certified used cars with warranty----
</H1>
<br>
As the auto industry has evolved, the way used cars are sold and purchased has evolved as well. Now, you don’t really need to rely on just the verbal assurance of a cunning car salesman, dealer or an individual regarding the used car being perfectly fine. You now have the power of certification at your fingertips!  One can easily go online and check for car certifications such as CarDekho Trustmark certified cars, which are meticulously checked by a certified car engineer to make sure your purchase is hassle free. Not just this, you can also get an additional post purchase warranty to ensure that the used car you just bought runs more like a new one!

<h1>
Reason 4: Slower depreciation means you lose less money----

</H1>
<br>
Every car undergoes depreciation but a used car has an upper hand for the same when compared to a new car. It depreciates at a slower rate when compared to a brand new car. Let’s find out how: Depreciation of a vehicle is at its peak during the first three years of purchase. When you are buying a used car, you will obviously purchase it at a price which has already gone under major depreciation. 
<br>
Here is how it generally works:
<br>
New Maruti Swift LXi	Used Maruti Swift LXi (1 year old)	
Depreciation value
<br>
Rs. 5,28, 057/- (on road price)	Rs 4,15,000/- (on road price)
<br>  	 
Rs 4,15,000 (Depreciation = Rs 1,13,057)  	Rs 3,59,000/- (Depreciation = Rs 56,000)  	After 1 year 
<br> 
Rs 3,42,000/- (Depreciation = Rs 73,000)	Rs 2,97,000/- (Depreciation = Rs 62,000)	After 3 years
<br>
Details mentioned above are tentative figures with average car running taken as 12,000 km per year
<br>

The difference between the depreciated amounts listed above of a brand new car over 3 years to a used car shows how less your used purchase will lose money over a brand new one.

    <h1>
Reason 5: Insurance is cheaper and you need not pay additional charges--- 
</h1>
<br>
Getting your used car insured will cost you a lot less as compared to a new car. That along with soaring additional taxes and other clauses makes a new car quite expensive. To find out better, consider a breakup below between the ex-showroom price and On The Road (OTR) price of a new car.
<br>
Ex-showroom price Maruti Suzuki Swift Lxi New Delhi - Rs. 4,71,613/-
<br>
RTO charges - Rs. 18,948/-
<br>
Insurance charge - Rs. 17,689/- (1 year insurance)
<br>

<br>

<br>
Handling charges - Rs. 6,000/-
<br>
